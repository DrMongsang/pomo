feat: Implement background timer, add LP, and favicon

This commit introduces significant new features and improvements:
- **Background Timer:** Implemented a robust background timer using Date.now() and visibilitychange event, ensuring timer accuracy even when the browser tab is not active.
- **Landing Page (LP):** Created a dedicated landing page (lp.html and lp.css) based on the QUEST formula to effectively introduce the "Pomo Shacho" app and its benefits.
- **Favicon:** Added a favicon (favicon.png) to enhance brand recognition in browser tabs and bookmarks.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:**
  - Added a "Help" button and modal with detailed explanations of the Pomodoro Technique, scientific evidence, in-game usage, and strategy tips.
  - Implemented auto-save functionality every 30 seconds.
  - Ensured "FUJIMO GAMES" credit is visible during timer display.
  - Adjusted "Game Start" button logic for better user experience.
