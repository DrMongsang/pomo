feat: Implement PWA features and background timer improvements

This commit focuses on enhancing the app's Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities and refining the background timer:
- **PWA Integration:** Added `manifest.json` and `apple-touch-icon` to enable "Add to Home Screen" functionality on mobile devices, providing an app-like experience.
- **Background Timer Refinement:** Further improved the background timer logic to ensure accurate time tracking and alarm triggering even when the app is not in the foreground.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:**
  - Added a descriptive text about the Pomodoro Technique's benefits on the opening screen.
  - Adjusted the main "Start Focus" button and other action buttons layout for better visibility and user flow.
  - Ensured "FUJIMO GAMES" credit is consistently visible.
